# `components` directory

Create your Vue components here. Components will be automatically registered and can be accessed without importing them.

For example, a `MyComponent.vue` file will generate a `<MyComponent>` component that can be used across all the application.

You can nest your components in folders and use them like so:

```vue
<!-- components/Foo/Bar/Baz.vue -->
<FooBarBaz />
```
